# Changelog

`sonar` is currently in active development with lots of moving pieces.
Once it has a more stable release cycle you will see more information
here.

For now our priorities are:

* Add support for as many browsers as possible.
* Stabilize the API.
* Document the code and how to use `sonar`.
* Create an online service and an editor plugin.
