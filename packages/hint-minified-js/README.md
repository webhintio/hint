# JavaScript should be minified (`minified-js`)

This hint checks whether JavaScript used by your web page is minified or not.

## Why is this important?

Minifying your JavaScript is a great way to improve your page load time.
This includes removing unused variables and methods, renaming variables
and methods to smaller names, removing code comments, etc.
Minification should generate a smaller file, and thus less code to parse.

## What does the hint check?

This hint generates an *"Improvement Index"* value for the script content
and compare it against a derived threshold value to determine whether the
content is minified or not.

Improvement index is generated by comparing the number of tokens
(from the abstract syntax tree generated from the code) with the
total content length of a file.

```javascript
const tokenRatio = tokenLength / contentLength;
const improvementIndex = Math.round((1 - tokenRatio) * 100);

if (improvementIndex > threshold) {
    // Script might be unminified
}
```

By default, the hint uses **`75`** as the threshold value to compare against.
If the calculated improvement index value is greater than the threshold,
the script will be flagged as unminified.

*The value 75 was derived after running tests on some of the mostly used
libraries and a couple of custom JavaScript files.* See the
[sample repo][Improvement Index tests repo] with the test files and results.

## Can the hint be configured?

By default, the hint uses **`75`** as the threshold value. But you can override
that with a custom value in your [`.hintrc`][hintrc] config:

```json
{
    "connector": {...},
    "formatters": [...],
    "parsers": ["javascript"],
    "hints": {
        "minified-js": ["error", {
            "threshold": 80
        }]
    },
    ...
}
```

## How to use this hint?

To use it you will have to install it via `npm`:

```bash
npm install minified-js
```

Note: You can make `npm` install it as a `devDependency` using the `--save-dev`
parameter, or to install it globally, you can use the `-g` parameter. For
other options see
[`npm`'s documentation][NPM documentation].

And then activate it via the [`.hintrc`][hintrc]
configuration file:

```json
{
    "connector": {...},
    "formatters": [...],
    "parsers": ["javascript"],
    "hints": {
        "minified-js": "error"
    },
    ...
}
```
